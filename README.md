1. Introduction to Docker
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in lightweight, portable containers. Containers allow you to package an application with all its dependencies and run it consistently across different environments.

Key Concepts
Container: A lightweight, standalone executable package that includes everything needed to run an application.

Image: A read-only template used to create containers.

Dockerfile: A text file containing instructions to build a Docker image.

Docker Hub: A cloud-based registry for sharing Docker images.
